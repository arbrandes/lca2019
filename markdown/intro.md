<!-- Note -->

Hi, my name is Florian and I’m here to tell you about a
set of tools that enables people to learn complex and sophisticated
software technology — in principle, _any_ such technology — with
minimal investment in infrastructure.

Now, this talk is scheduled for 45 minutes and if my rehearsal timing
is any indication, then I might be filling that time slot completely
and we might not have time for questions in the end. Thus, since the
LCA crowd is normally very active on Twitter, here’s what I’d like you
to do: you see my Twitter handle up there on the screen, so if you
have a question, please blurt it out on Twitter, tag my handle, and
maybe add the `#lca2019` hashtag.
