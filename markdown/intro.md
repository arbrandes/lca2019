Hi, my name is Florian and I’m here to tell you about a
set of tools that enables people to learn complex and sophisticated
software technology — in principle, _any_ such technology — with
minimal investment in infrastructure. Now if you were at LCA last
year, you may have attended the education miniconf there, and in that
miniconf I already did a talk on a similar topic. However at the time
I focused on the _educational_ aspects of what I’m about to cover,
whereas this time around I am going over the _technical details_ of
building such a platform.

If you want to go back to what I covered last year, there is of course
a video thanks to the wonderful A/V team from LCA 2018, and the
YouTube link is up here:
